#  Step Response Plots
This file contains the results from the step response conducted on our RC circuit. We utilized a digital multimeter to measure the resistance and capacitance, and with these numbers were able to determine a time constant of 0.305 seconds. Our experimental results, gathered by setting the output pin to high to charge capacitor and then setting it to low to let it discharge, gave us a time constant of 0.308 seconds. This resulted in a 0.98% error, falling into the range of acceptable tollerancs for electronic components. A step response and picture of our experimental setup can be seen below.
